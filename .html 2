		<img src="Citadel Photo.jpg" width="200" height="250" alt="Seth Davis" title="Seth Davis">
		<p>My name is Seth Davis. I was born in Minnestoa, but my family moved to Maine when I was two, so I consider myself to be a, "Mainer." I have two older brothers, an older sister, and one younger brother. My two older brothers both attended West Point and are in the United States Army. One is stationed in Arizona, and the other in Hawaii. My sister is currently a student at Harvard University, and my younger brother is still in high school, and lives at home with my parents. 
		Ever since I can remember, I've loved the outdoors: fishing, hunting, hiking, four-wheeling. You name it, and I probably enjoy doing it! I also enjoy playing sports, working out, playing video games. hnaging out with friends, and baking. 
		Last semester I was at The Citadel (The Military College of South Carolina), but due to financial reasons, I returned to Maine and I am currently a part of the Army ROTC program on campus. My life's dream is to become an Army officer and serve my country to the best of my ability. I truly cannot wait to begin my life's journey in the United States Army. </p>

		<p>My time at The Citadel was rather interesting. Upon arrival I was exposed to the military environment that shocked me, and made me question whether or not I had made the right college choice. I can truly say that my first month at The Citadel was the worst month of my life. The Citadel is not like most military schools. They have a set of guidelines that all freshmen, or "Knobs" must abide by. The rules are called the, "4th Class System." These rules require all, "Knobs" to brace at all times while in the dorms, (bracing is simply sticking one's chin in to make wrinkles under the chin while standing or walking in a rigid manner). It also requires all "Knobs" to remain silent at all times, unless in a classroom environment, in their own rooms, or if they are spoken to by an upperclassmen or military officer. It also requires "Knobs" to march everywhere in a formation. This includes PT, breakfast, lunch, dinner, assembilies, etc... Along with this, while at the dining hall, the 4th class system requires all "Knobs" to eat sitting on the edge of the chair, and to square all bites (picking up the food and putting it in your mouth in a square motion). You can start to see why this wasn't an enjoyable culture for someone to be in. 
		After my first month of living by the 4th class system, I became so used to it, that I was no longer bothered by the stupidity of what I was doing. In fact, I began to somewhat like it. I made friends with fellow cadets, enjoyed the city of Charleston while on weekend leave, and really began to appreciate the kind of person I was becoming because of these, "stupid rules." As time progressed, and the semester began to near its end, I came to the realization that unless the Army was able to pay for more of my schooling, I wasn't going to be able to return for the next semester. In my final week at The Citadel I recieved word that I the Army was unable to pay for the next semester of my school, and so it was official... I would be returning to Maine and begining all over in the Army program on the campus of Orono. </p>

		<p>To begin my second semester of college, I showed up to The Universtiy of Maine not knowing what to expect. My roommate laughed at me quite a bit due to the stupid questions I would ask. Coming from a college where I wasn't allowed to do much of anything, the thought of being able to do pretty much whatever I wanted was quite foreign to me. As I began my first couple of weeks I didn't care much for UMO, but as time went on, I made friends, and the campus made for a much more enjoyable college experience. Not to mention, I'm able to go home whenever I want now, whereas before I couldn't go home without being $400 dollars poorer, and having a 24 hour travel day. Along with all this, the Army program at the University of Maine was just rated by the United States Army as one of the top ROTC programs in the nation. I knew having come from The Citadel that Maine's ROTC program was better, but never would I have imagined that it was one of the top programs in the nation. All in all, I've begun to enjoy my time at University of Maine Orono, and I can't wait to see what the future has in store for me. </p>

		<p>As I mentioned in the, "About Me" section, my life's dream is to become an officer in the United States Army. Along with that I hope to branch infantry and obtain my Ranger Tab, and go on to serve my country to the best of my ability. Although this may sound cliche, it's a big motivater in my life to do what I'm doing each and every day. As former President John F. Kennedy said, "Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country." That line from his speech has stuck with me during every difficult challenge I've had to face concerning the military, and that's why I felt led to do what I'm doing. After my cerrer in the Army, I would like to retire and move back to the New England area to either become a police officer, or open up my own little diner. I've enjoyed cooking and baking ever since I was small, and I don't believe it would be a bad job after a stressful career in the Army. Not to mention I'd be back in, "Pat's Nation" with my fellow Patriots.</p>
